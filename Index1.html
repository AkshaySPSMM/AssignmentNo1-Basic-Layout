                    In a thrilling match at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, St Lucia, India secured a 24-run victory over Australia in their final Super-8 game of the T20 World Cup, setting up a semi-final clash against England. The win was highlighted by Arshdeep Singh's triple strike and Kuldeep Yadav's double wicket haul, which effectively dismantled the Australian batting lineup. Arshdeep's precision and swing, along with Kuldeep's clever variations, created immense pressure on the Australians.
                    Despite Travis Head's strong performance, scoring a rapid half-century, Jasprit Bumrah delivered a crucial blow by dismissing Head with a perfect yorker, sealing the match for India. Earlier, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma showcased an explosive batting display, scoring 92 off just 41 balls, propelling India to a formidable total of 205/5. His innings was characterized by aggressive power hitting that demoralized the Australian bowlers.
                    Australia's captain Mitch Marsh, who won the toss and chose to field, faced an uphill battle as India's disciplined bowling and sharp fielding maintained control throughout the game. Australia's hopes were further diminished by Afghanistan's thrilling victory over Bangladesh, which advanced Afghanistan to their first-ever semi-finals, ending Australia's campaign in the tournament.
                    <!-- Rohit's onslaught was well-supported by contributions from other Indian batsmen, who played their roles to perfection. The Indian middle order ensured that the momentum generated by Rohit's innings was not lost, propelling India to a formidable total of 205/5 in their allotted 20 overs. The Australian bowlers, despite their best efforts, found it challenging to contain the Indian batsmen on a pitch that offered little assistance. -->
                    <!-- Australia's chase began on a shaky note, with Arshdeep Singh's early strikes putting them on the back foot. Despite a brief recovery led by Travis Head, the regular fall of wickets prevented Australia from gaining any significant momentum. Kuldeep Yadav's middle-overs spell further tightened the noose around the Australian batsmen. The Indian bowlers maintained their discipline, executing their plans meticulously. -->
                    With this victory, India not only secured their place in the semi-finals but also sent a strong message to their upcoming opponents. The team's all-round performance showcased their strength and depth in both batting and bowling departments. The win against Australia will undoubtedly boost their confidence as they prepare to face England in the semi-finals.
                    On the other hand, Australia's hopes of advancing were dashed, compounded by Afghanistan's thrilling victory over Bangladesh. This result propelled Afghanistan into their first-ever semi-finals, marking a historic achievement for the team. The T20 World Cup continues to deliver exciting and unpredictable moments, keeping fans on the edge of their seats as the tournament progresses towards its climax.
